getting a .pcapng file , investigating the data it is meaningless but noting it is sent from localhost to itself 

but noting time stamps it looks like it sent almost in same time (ms differences) so it should be packets for same data . i saved it as a raw data and let's rot 13 it and see 

note : if not all packets saved it will affect last output :) 
with this recipe :
